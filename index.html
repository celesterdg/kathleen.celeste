    <p>In many cultures the concept of human beauty is directly related to the skin condition, because beautiful skin – is healthy skin. General condition of human skin depends on the overall state of the organism, living conditions, hygiene regime, etc. Thus, we are going to talk about human skin, describing its structure and different ways how to protect it from overexposure to sun. Also it is necessary to explain differences between first- and second-degree sunburns, and several types of the first aid for them. First of all it is necessary to mention that skin physiologically changes during lifespan, gradually changing its form and structure. The desire to keep own skin healthy and make age-related changes in it more harmonious always depends on the person. </p>
    <p>Skin is a reflection of everything that happens in human organism. And having any problem with skin it is necessary, firstly, to check the overall health state and not ‘run’ to the beautician or try to solve the problem by self.</p>
    <p>This layer is a kind of barrier to the negative effects on the body of various factors, and it protects us from mechanical, physical and harmful biological effects. The epidermis is composed of 5 layers and each of these layers matures on each other, thus continuous renewal of the skin has its constant place here. Young and healthy skin complete its renewal process in the epidermal cells within 28 days, and it is obvious that the period increases slightly with age. Finally, main features of the structure of the epidermis are to provide it with flexibility, elasticity and strength; moreover, high regenerative properties contribute to rapid recovery with the least damage. The next layer is dermis and it consists of intertwined elastic and collagen tissues.</p>
